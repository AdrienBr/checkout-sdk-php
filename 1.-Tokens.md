Exchange card details or a digital wallet payment token for a reference token that can be later used to request a card payment.

⚠️ In order to generate tokens, set `public_key = '{public_key_goes_here}'` in the configuration file or by calling `$checkout->channel()->setPublicKey($publicKey)`.

### Full card
Generate a token for a card. The CVV number requirement depends on the account set up.

```php
$card = new Checkout\Models\Tokens\Card('4242424242424242', 01, 2020);
$card->cvv = '100';
$token = $checkout->tokens()
                  ->request($card);
```


### Google Pay
To start processing Google Pay payments, you must first integrate directly with Google. Once integration is complete, you can add the 'Google Pay' button to your checkout page and start requesting your customers' encrypted payment information. Learn more about Google Pay [here](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/google-pay).

```php
$googlepay = new Checkout\Models\Tokens\GooglePay($protocolVersion, $signature, $signedMessage);
$token = $checkout->tokens()
                  ->request($googlepay);
```


### Apple Pay
To get started with Apple Pay payments, you must first download your Certificate Signing Request from The Hub and upload it to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/). Learn more about Apple Pay [here](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/apple-pay).

```php
$header = new Checkout\Models\Tokens\ApplePayHeader($transactionId, $publicKeyHash, $ephemeralPublicKey);
$applepay = new Checkout\Models\Tokens\ApplePay($version, $signature, $data, $header);
$token = $checkout->tokens()
                  ->request($applepay);
```
